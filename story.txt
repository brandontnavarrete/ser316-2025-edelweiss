A Porsche sat outside of a magic shop late one night.
The driver got out of the car and brought his Hund.
The Hund was wearing Lederhose and was wearing a shirt with a Schloss, and then 
inquired where some delicious Bratwurst can be found.
Luckily for the hund, he noticed the members of Rammstein were walking down the street.
